My honest opinion :
I thought it will be easy to code in C#, but ITS ACTUALLY SUPER HARD, I need to re-read a lot of the code to understand what it does, and the UI of the Visual studio does not help. However, I still hope I can keep learning and be familiar with Visual Studio and ASP.NET
(Its my first time please give me a chance)
